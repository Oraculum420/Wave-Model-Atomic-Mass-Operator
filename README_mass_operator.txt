Mass Operator with Observed Mass Comparison
===========================================

Overview
--------
This Python script computes atomic mass values using a hybrid symbolic wave-based mass operator.
It supports both SciPy numerical integration (if available) and a trapezoidal fallback method.

Features
--------
- Contains all mass numbers from 1 to 114 with calibrated wave parameters.
- Computes mass using sinusoidal and exponential decay functions.
- Includes observed atomic masses (when available).
- Calculates and displays the percent error between predicted and observed mass.

Dependencies
------------
- Python 3.x
- SciPy (optional, improves integration accuracy)

Usage
-----
Run the script from the command line with the desired mass number:

    python3 mass_operator_full_114_with_observed.py [MassNumber]

Example:

    python3 mass_operator_full_114_with_observed.py 16

This will output:

    Computed mass for A=16: 15.994914
    Observed mass: 32.06
    Percent error: -50.082183%

Output Fields
-------------
- Computed Mass: Mass predicted by the wave-based operator
- Observed Mass: Known mass from NIST or standard sources (if available)
- Percent Error: Deviation of prediction from observed value

Fallback Mode
-------------
If SciPy is not installed, the script uses a trapezoidal integration method.
