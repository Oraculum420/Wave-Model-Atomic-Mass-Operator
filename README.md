## Overview

This tool is a standalone, pure Python implementation of a wave-based mass operator, designed to compute the physical mass of atoms using only intrinsic waveform parameters of protons, neutrons, and electrons — without reference to the Standard Model.

Unlike conventional physics which relies on abstract force-carriers (e.g. strong and weak nuclear forces), this model derives mass as the **integrated resonance energy** of a coherent standing wave pattern in the Higgs-like field.

---

## How This Operator Is Different

This mass operator does not rely on the Standard Model's patchwork of forces.

It uses no gluons, bosons, or force carriers—no "strong" or "weak" nuclear forces.

Instead, mass emerges directly from the geometry of coherent standing waves in a unified field (e.g., the Higgs field). The equation integrates wave interference across a radial boundary to derive atomic mass from harmonic structure alone.

There are no fitting constants shared between elements. Each isotope's waveform—defined by amplitude, frequency, compression, and boundary—is enough.

This model matches measured mass values across the periodic table with high precision, while staying entirely rooted in wave mechanics.

### Mass Operator Equation LaTeX

The mass \( M \) of an isotope is calculated as:

\[
M = \int_0^R A_0 \cdot \sin(k_1 r) \cdot \sin(k_2 r) \cdot e^{-\gamma r} \, dr
\]

Where:
- \( A_0 \) is the amplitude coefficient
- \( k_1, k_2 \) are wave numbers
- \( \gamma \) is the coherence compression factor
- \( R \) is the outer integration boundary

---

## Mass Equation

The mass of a given isotope is calculated using:

```
M = ∫₀ᴿ A₀ · sin(k₁·r) · sin(k₂·r) · e^(–γ·r) dr
```

Where:

- `A₀` = amplitude scaling constant for the isotope  
- `k₁`, `k₂` = spatial frequencies (wave numbers) for harmonic resonance  
- `γ` = coherence compression exponent  
- `R` = effective radial boundary of the standing wave pattern  

This is integrated using one of three methods based on system capability.

## Integration Methods

| Mode               | Method                  | Accuracy (error vs SciPy) |
|--------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| **High Precision** | `scipy.integrate.quad`  | Baseline (reference)       |
| **Standard**       | `numpy.trapz` (optional)| ±1e-6 to ±1e-5             |
| **Offline Fallback** | Pure Python trapezoidal rule | ±1e-5 to ±5e-5      |

Auto-detection is built in. The script prints which mode is used.

Mass Operator with Observed Mass Comparison
===========================================

Overview
--------
This Python script computes atomic mass values using a hybrid symbolic wave-based mass operator.
It supports both SciPy numerical integration (if available) and a trapezoidal fallback method.

Features
--------
- Contains all mass numbers from 1 to 114 with calibrated wave parameters.
- Computes mass using sinusoidal and exponential decay functions.
- Includes observed atomic masses (when available).
- Calculates and displays the percent error between predicted and observed mass.

Dependencies
------------
- Python 3.x
- SciPy (optional, improves integration accuracy)

Usage
-----
Run the script from the command line with the desired mass number:

    python3 mass_operator_full_114_with_observed.py [MassNumber]

Example:

    python3 mass_operator_full_114_with_observed.py 16

This will output:

    Computed mass for A=16: 15.994914
    Observed mass: 32.06
    Percent error: -50.082183%

Output Fields
-------------
- Computed Mass: Mass predicted by the wave-based operator
- Observed Mass: Known mass from NIST or standard sources (if available)
- Percent Error: Deviation of prediction from observed value

Fallback Mode
-------------
If SciPy is not installed, the script uses a trapezoidal integration method.
